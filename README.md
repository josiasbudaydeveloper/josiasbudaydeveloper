## Full-Stack JS developer
My name is Josias Buday Dias, I'm from Brazil and I'm currently studying Full-Stack JS development for the PMERN Stack (PostGreSQL, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js), but I still need to study some techonologies, like PostGreSQL, Sequelize and React.js.

For now, I'm finishing my studies of development and preparing myself to apply for job vacancies and/or freelancing jobs.
