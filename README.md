# Josias Buday Dias
## A Full-Stack JS Developer
Full Stack React/Next Developer with TypeScript.

In summary, I'm capable of develop:

Complete Full-Stack Systems with Next.js 14's App Router:
- Many Pages with a beautiful Responsive Web Design that are Single Page Applications (SPA) and 
 counts with a good SEO
- Searching bar feature based on search params
- Pagination 
- Dark Mode with Tailwind.css
- Authentication with Auth.js and JWT tokens stored on the browser's cookies
- Database connection that could be pretty much any relational database and MongoDB
- Hosting it on Vercel or on more advanced cloud providers, in case of necessity

Advanced Back-End Systems with Express.js:
- RestFul API's with JWT authentication
- Automated Tests with Jest

API's:
- I have some experience of working with the OpenAI's API using the ChatGPT's GPT-3.5-PLUS model
- I also have some experience of studying how does the Zabbix API works (based on JSON information sent with the POST HTTP Method), also known as JSON RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

## The Offline Ones
- Projects made during a course of Back-End development with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Microservices I did in 2022:
  * [visit repo on GitHub](https://github.com/josiasbudaydeveloper/LuizTools-Node.js-MongoDB)
- A Full Stack JS project I did partially (for now), during the Web Full Stack JS Course by LuizTools and DLZ Tecnologia. Even this project is incomplete in terms of all of its features, there are two completely developed API's built with Express, Sequelize and TypeScript there you can check out. Its Front-End is based on React.js and React-Bootstrap v5.
