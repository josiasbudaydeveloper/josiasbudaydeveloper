In summary, I'm capable of develop:

Complete Full-Stack Systems with Next.js 14's App Router:
- Many Pages with a beautiful Responsive Web Design that are Single Page Applications (SPA) and 
 counts with a good SEO
- Searching bar feature based on search params
- Pagination 
- Dark Mode with Tailwind.css
- Authentication with Auth.js and JWT tokens stored on the browser's cookies

- RestFul API's with JWT authentication
- Automated Tests with Jest

API's:
- I have some experience of working with the OpenAI's API using the ChatGPT's GPT-3.5-PLUS model
